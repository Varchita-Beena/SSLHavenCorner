# Paper: Image Segmentation Using Text and Image Prompts

This paper introduces a novel system designed to generate image segmentations using various types of prompts during testing. These prompts can be either in the form of text or images. The system is trained to perform three distinct segmentation tasks, each with its own unique challenges. These tasks include referring expression segmentation, zero-shot segmentation, and one-shot segmentation.

To achieve this, the authors utilize CLIP as the foundational model. CLIP is a pre-trained model that understands visual and textual information. They enhance CLIP by integrating a transformer-based decoder, which enables the model to make dense predictions for segmentation tasks. This decoder takes the information learned by CLIP and uses it to produce detailed segmentation maps.

The model is trained using the PhraseCut dataset. This dataset contains binary segmentation maps associated with images, generated based on free-text prompts. This innovative approach allows the model to dynamically adapt not only to the specific segmentation tasks mentioned earlier but also to any binary segmentation task that can be formulated using either text or image queries. In essence, this system can generate accurate segmentations by interpreting prompts and producing segmentation maps accordingly.

The authors use the joint text-visual embedding space of CLIP to condition their model. This means they can provide prompts in the form of either text descriptions or images to guide the segmentation process.

The authors emphasize that they want the decoder to learn from CLIP's embeddings while avoiding biases from specific datasets. They aim to maintain CLIP's strong predictive capabilities while ensuring the decoder can perform accurate segmentations across various tasks.

CLIPSeg is designed for binary segmentation, where the model distinguishes between a specific foreground (which matches the prompt) and the background. This binary approach can be adapted to multi-label predictions, such as in Pascal zero-shot segmentation.

While the primary focus is on creating a versatile model, CLIPSeg is shown to achieve competitive performance across three different low-shot segmentation tasks. It can generalize to classes and descriptions for which it has never seen a segmentation before.

1. Generalized Zero-Shot Segmentation:
In this scenario, the goal is to perform image segmentation for both categories that the model has seen during training and categories that it hasn't seen before (unseen categories). To achieve this, the model uses some form of relationship between the seen and unseen categories. For instance, word embeddings or WordNet can be employed to establish connections between these categories, enabling the model to generalize its understanding and perform segmentation on unseen categories based on the knowledge it has acquired from the seen categories.

2. One-Shot Segmentation:
The model is given an additional image. This additional image represents a specific class that needs to be segmented in the query image. Along with this image, there is a mask provided. The mask indicates the exact region of interest within the additional image that corresponds to the class to be segmented. The query image is the main image that the model needs to perform segmentation on. It's the image where the desired class (that corresponds to the additional image and mask) needs to be identified and outlined. The additional image and its corresponding mask serve as a reference or guide for the model. The model analyzes the provided image and mask to understand what the target class looks like and where it's located within the image. Based on the information learned from the additional image and mask, the model then applies this knowledge to the query image. It identifies the similar features and patterns in the query image that match the target class from the additional image. The model uses this reference to perform accurate segmentation of the target class within the query image. It's like giving the model a "cheat sheet" in the form of the additional image and mask to help it accurately segment the desired class in the query image.

3. Referring Expression Segmentation:
The training process involves using detailed text queries. Each text query provides a description of a particular region or object within an image that needs to be segmented. These queries can be quite complex and descriptive, guiding the model about what to look for and segment. During the model's training phase, it is exposed to a diverse set of images and text queries, covering a wide range of categories (classes or objects). The model learns to understand the relationships between the descriptive text queries and the corresponding regions or objects within the images. When it comes to testing the model, a new image is provided along with a text query that describes a specific region or object within that image. The model uses its training experience to comprehend the query and its intended meaning. Since the model was trained on various text queries and their corresponding image regions, it knows how to interpret and follow the instructions provided in the text query. It uses this knowledge to accurately segment the area or object described in the query within the new image. Importantly, there is no requirement for the model to generalize its understanding to unseen categories. This is because during training, the model was exposed to all possible categories it might encounter. Its task is to effectively interpret the text query and perform segmentation based on what it learned from training. While referring expression segmentation is supervised, it's important to note that the supervision comes in the form of textual descriptions rather than direct pixel-wise labels. The model learns to generate segmentation masks guided by these descriptions, and its performance is evaluated based on its ability to accurately segment images based on novel text queries.

In zero-shot or few-shot segmentation scenarios, the pretrained model is not explicitly trained for all categories. Instead, it's trained on a set of categories during its initial pretraining phase. This means that the model has learned to extract features and patterns from the data, but it might not have seen examples from every possible category it might encounter later.

In zero-shot segmentation, the model is expected to generalize its understanding to segments/categories that it hasn't seen during training. For example, if the model was pretrained on images of animals and objects like cars, but it hasn't seen images of specific types of birds, it's expected to use its learned knowledge to segment those unseen categories (birds) during testing.

In few-shot segmentation, the model might have seen a few examples from a new category, but not enough to become an expert at segmenting it. It needs to quickly adapt its existing knowledge to perform segmentation on these new categories with limited examples.

Both zero-shot and few-shot segmentation are challenging tasks because they require the model to apply its learned knowledge to new or underrepresented categories. It's a way of evaluating the model's ability to generalize its understanding beyond its initial training categories.
